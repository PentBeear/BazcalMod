# BazcalMod
The Bazcal Discord bot but implemented into Minecraft!


There are extra steps in installing this mod currently

Go the oracle java 8 JRE download page (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html)
And download the Windows x64 version. After installing that
Open the Minecraft Launcher go to Installations
Click on your forge installation
Click More Options
And Click browse and go to C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_***\bin\javaw.exe
the *** represents the highest number you have installed.
Save this and the mod should work ;)

Reason: For some reason minecrafts default jvm is still java 1.8.0_51
and i use new features that are hard to replace in the older versions.

Extra tips:
When starting the Bazcal Flip don't MOVE. or jump off a cliff. You currently lag a bit and who knows what happens if you are falling and that happens. (most likely nothing but still dont do it)
